# Gorp-Port TODO List
-Do lots of polishing shit, notably crafting recipes & cooking values (DONE)

-Add front flames big grill, and cookpots, but dont add gorge fire itself

-Remove Mumsy & Goatkid, but not elder pig or merms.

-Remove all traces of gnaw & gnaw snackrificing, pointless, just use gold as trading for e. pig and merms or something

-Polish the fuck out of pebble crabs, they burrow but they have shadows, they constantly repeat burrow animation, etc.

-allow birds to drop different kinds of gorge seeds
-Redo mainland seeds to look much more mix-and-matchey
-Redo specific-food-type-mainland-seeds to look much more unique

----------

Specific Issues

-SaltRack item displays as "saltRack item" in inventory, annoying as fuck (DONE)
-Salt rack's salt dissappears upon relogging (ON HOLD, JESUS CHRIST THAT IS HARD TO FIX)
-Salt rock & salt shaker cannot be examined/inspected (DONE)
-Some set pieces look weird and amature, notably the gnaw one, remove gnaw shit, polish merm shit
